What is Frigear?

#description
Frigear is a volunteer-driven non-profit association that **runs cultural projects** (and helps others get theirs started).
We build communities around **art, culture, and volunteering** — ideally with **reuse, renewable energy technology, green products**, and professional, inclusive collaboration.

Frigear is also a **play-and-learning platform**: a place where you can try things out, level up your skills, and create something together with others.
We’re for anyone **driven by engagement and curiosity**, and by the desire to **build open and sustainable project solutions** — **together**.

**Come as you are** — with hands, brains, ideas, curiosity… or just the urge to join in and create something awesome.

Volunteer community

#description
Frigear is run by volunteers — we’re a mixed bunch with backgrounds in craftsmanship, technology, design, association life, and everything in between.
What we share is the desire to use our time and skills on something that **creates cultural and social value**.

We believe volunteering can be both **meaningful and fun**. And yes — it often ends up in strong friendships and great stories.

Our vision

#description
We want to be a catalyst for volunteering and development in **creative, cultural, and social communities**.

**The dream?** More places where you can meet, build, pursue interests, learn, and share knowledge — places where it feels natural to **unfold your ideas and skills** without being boxed in by an overload of rules and expectations before ideas have even had a chance.

About inclusion

#description
Frigear is an open and inclusive community. We do not discriminate based on ethnicity, skin color, gender, sexuality, age, religion, or political stance.
We’re here for **volunteering and togetherness**.

We have zero tolerance for discrimination and actively work to ensure a safe environment for everyone.

**Everyone is welcome in Frigear.**

Sustainable engagement

#description
Volunteering should be sustainable over time. 
With us, there’s room for everyday life, breaks, and periods with lower energy — that’s completely normal, and it should be okay to say no.

We aim for **realistic ambitions**, clear frameworks, and a culture where you contribute in a way that makes sense — and where we speak up if a task is too heavy or we need help.
In short: **volunteering together, on your own terms**.

#description
We’re always open to collaborating with associations, organizations, and companies that share our values.
When we work together across communities, we can create more — and learn more.
