  Security policy (overview)

  #description
  Frigear protects personal and organisational data using a risk-based security program following **ISO/IEC 27001** principles (confidentiality, integrity, availability) and is aligned with EU data protection requirements.

  This page describes our **baseline controls**. Some projects and partnerships may apply stricter requirements depending on risk and legal obligations.

  1\. Who is responsible?

  #description
  The nonprofit organisation Frigear, CVR-nr. 44353261, is responsible for ensuring appropriate technical and organisational security measures.

  Access to systems and data is granted only to volunteers/admins, accounting and legal representatives who need it to perform their role, and is reviewed regularly.

  2\. Access control & authentication

  #description
  We reduce the risk of unauthorised access by using:

  - Role-based access (least privilege)
  - Unique user accounts (no shared logins for sensitive systems)
  - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) where available
  - Strong password policies and secure password storage
  - Regular access reviews and offboarding when roles change

  3\. Encryption & secure communication

  #description
  We protect data in transit and, where supported, at rest:

  - HTTPS/TLS for web traffic and APIs
  - Encrypted connections between services (where supported)
  - Secure handling of secrets (API keys, tokens) and environment variables
  - Principle: never send sensitive data in plaintext channels

  4\. Data minimisation & retention

  #description
  Security starts by collecting less:

  - We only collect data needed for membership administration, volunteering, events, and agreed partnerships
  - We limit access to sensitive data (e.g. payment-related data) and keep it separate where possible
  - We delete or anonymise data when it is no longer needed, aligned with our privacy policy and legal obligations

  5\. Hosting, suppliers & partnerships

  #description
  We use reputable providers and rely on their independently-audited security and compliance programs, proportionate to risk.

  **Core providers**
  - **Cloudflare** (security/performance edge services): publishes compliance resources covering **SOC 2 Type II** and their posture around **ISO 27001 / ISO 27701** and **PCI DSS**:
    - https://www.cloudflare.com/trust-hub/
    - https://www.cloudflare.com/trust-hub/compliance-resources/

  - **Google** (Google Workspace): lists independent certifications such as **ISO/IEC 27001** and privacy-related cloud standards like **ISO/IEC 27018 / ISO/IEC 27701** (availability varies by product and scope):
    - https://workspace.google.com/learn-more/security/security-whitepaper/page-5/
    - https://business.safety.google/compliance/

  - **Microsoft** (Microsoft 365): publishes compliance offerings and audit reports (including **ISO 27001** and related frameworks) via the Microsoft compliance documentation and the Service Trust Portal:
    - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/compliance/regulatory/offering-home
    - https://servicetrust.microsoft.com/

  **Payments (we do not store card numbers)**
  - **Stripe**: states **SOC 1** and **SOC 2 Type II** audits and **PCI Service Provider Level 1**:
    - https://docs.stripe.com/security
    - https://stripe.com/guides/pci-compliance

  - **MobilePay** (Vipps MobilePay): states **PCI DSS compliant payment services** and that they handle **PSD2/SCA** requirements:
    - https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/plugins-ext/checkout-magento/
    - https://developer.vippsmobilepay.com/docs/knowledge-base/merchant-info/

  6\. Monitoring, logging & incident response

  #description
  We aim to detect issues early and respond quickly:

  - Audit logs where available (admin actions, access events)
  - Alerts for suspicious activity (where supported)
  - Incident handling process: contain → assess impact → remediate → document → improve controls
  - We notify relevant parties when required by law or contractual obligations

  7\. Backups & recovery

  #description
  Availability matters too:

  - Backups for critical data where the platform supports it
  - Recovery procedures tested when feasible
  - We design systems to reduce single points of failure, proportional to project size and risk
